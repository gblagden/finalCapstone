# NLP Capstone Project - _Task 1_
In this task, I was asked to categorise which type of NLP application applies for each of the use-cases outlined in the instructions.  I only used examples that I had learned about during my bootcamp.

# NLP Capstone Project - _Task 2_
For this task, I was asked to read up on any innovative technology I could find that uses NLP, and then write a brief summary about the technology that I found. I chose to write about Amazon Comprehend, an NLP service within the AWS infrastructure that uses machine learning to acquire valuable insights from any piece of text.

# Minesweeper Program
I have created a fun program called **Minesweeper**.  I ask the user to place 'mines' on a 5x5 grid, wherever they like.  I then return the grid to the user, where every 'mine-free' spot has been replaced by a digit, indicating the number of mines immediately adjacent to that spot i.e. (horizontally, vertically, and diagonally).

# Cafe Stock Worth Calculator
I really wanted to create a real-world 'stock worth' calculator for a cafe.  So I have submitted two options for this task.  This is a robust, 'bug-proof' inventory/stock/price calculator for a cafe in the real world...!

# Finance Calculators
With this progrom, I have created a program that allows the user to access two different financial calculators: an investment calculator and a home loan repayment calculator.
